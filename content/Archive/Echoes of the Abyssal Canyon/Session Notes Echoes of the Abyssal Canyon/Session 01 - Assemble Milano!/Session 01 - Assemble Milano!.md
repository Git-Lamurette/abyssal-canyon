We begun our adventure at a small hall in [[Alesana]]. It was an orientation for [[The Marked Ones]] as our adventurers found themselves in the need of gold and adventure. [[Birch Bark]] begun to address the crowd and welcome everyone to the orientation, explaining they require teams of three for the orientation to encourage everyone to come back alive he was interrupted. A small racoon boy came in and stole his binder of the current jobs available and ran out with cackle and glee. At this point he shouted “ Uhh everyone start to pair up I will be right back” as he scuttled out of the room following his son.

From here the people begun to mingle and Klint and Donny looked a bit loss. At this point sweet ol’ Maxine who volunteered to handle the refreshment and snacks came over to offer them some treats in a way to enage them. During Maxine's food gathering Birch ran back into the room with a young boy in tow and a binder. “Sorry for the delay” he stated as he sat down and lines begun to form.  
  
Maxine returned with essentially the entire buffet table worth of snacks and the group begun to warm up. As the group slowly began to chat they look around to find the room has emptied out and a Birch sitting there with two jobs left sitting on the table as he beckoned them over. As the group approached them he re-stated that they needed a group of three and they where the only two left in the room. At this point Birch looked over Maxine and in his sly Urkin ways he tried to bribe her to join for 75g pieces. After she refused he then offered her 150g pieces just to make sure they stay alive. To which she reluctantly said yes.  
  
Here he had two local jobs presented. The first one seems like they where having some trouble with large snakes in the woods larger than typical, and their is a local fishing tournament at  
[[Sapphire Lake]] that needed some protection. From here as the group debated to Birch’s surprise there was one more job under his chair that must have fallen when the young racoon boy originally spirited away the documents. This job was that the farm was having issues with goblins and needed some people to protect the farm and handle them.  
  
After some discussion the group agreed to settle on the fishing tournament guarding as it seemed to be the easiest start to this adventure.  
  
From there Donny and Maxine ran some errand and settled in for the evening, as Klint took the job of securing them rides to the Sapphire Lake area. From here he journeyed over to  
[[Starfall Orchards]] to secure themselves on Boco’s to ride. One the way into the orchard he was rudely called a “Tiny man on a bear” by some rich children in a carriage as they passed him on the road.  
  
At the orchard he met a young boy who seemed to not want to help anyone sitting behind a desk. The boy proclaimed it is a 10g to rent two Bocos to which the poor Klint realized was all his money. When the boy saw that Klint was hesitating he stated that it is only 2g to pay as a deposit for the Bocos to which Klint readily agreed.
