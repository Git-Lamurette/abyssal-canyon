After a relaxing evening the group found themselves heading over to [[Starfall Orchards]] to pick up their Bocos. When they arrived they found that the young boy was nowhere to be found but they found an older gentlemen by the name of [[Robert Starfall]]. Very quickly they realized that the young boy was his grandson and swindled them out of their money, as their is no reservations and the cost to rent a boco was about 50G refundable deposit each. Robert quickly apologized and offered them a refund of the 2G that the young boy took from them. Seeing their adventure was in danger Maxine saw an opportunity arise, as she saw a very elaborate cat around the side of the building. While Klint was in discussion with Robert, herself and Donny took it upon themselves to steal this cart, hook it up to Tibbers and take off. From there they swung around the front and where gone clean way.. or so they think.

  

About a full day journey to the town of [[Minnow Brook]] they where ambushed by a group of four [[Flying Snake]]s which they quickly took care of. From there the rest of the trip was very uneventful.

  

When the arrived to the town they where dazzled with the lights and action, this small fishing village has been taken over by the proceeding celebrations. There is a large section of tents where everyone is resting, stalls with all kinds of foods and alcohol. Before the group joined the festivities they took some time to put the carriage on bricks and burry the wheels in an effort to hide the premium nature of their ride.  
  
Nestled in the back along the dock house they saw the hustle and bustled of the event organizers running around. They make their way back to find the individual they have to talk to and encountered a very drunk  
[[Linus Redbeard]] who was their contact. After some discussion it was discovered that there is some bandits who have been attempting to steal the top price, a beautiful Glassite blade with some magical properties.  
  
From there the group decided to relax for a few hours and enjoy the festivities. Donny had some nice trash, while the others ate at some of the stalls. Maxine bought fishing supplies for everyone while Klint just insulted the shop keepers. From their they did have a successfuly fishing adventure as Donny caught a large trout for the group, from there they discovered a mommy kitten and babies hidden under the dock begging for food. The gang was able to corral them and tuck them away neatly into their ornate carriage for the night.  

  
They where directed to the tents where they came accross some men in black who claimed they where from the foundation and guarding the tent, the Milanos where just brought in as a support to their cause. The men felt very suspect and not at all professional but they went forward with it for a job is a job.  
  
They settles in around the roadside guarding against the forest when they where attacked by a  
[[Bandit Captain]] and two of his [[Abyssal Canyon/D&D 5e SRD/SRD - Creatures/Bandit|Bandit]] cronies.  
  
After a long and climatic battle they have defeated the attackers. Unfortunately the night is not over as Maxine was struck down and they investigate these bandits.
