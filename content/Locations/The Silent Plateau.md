## Description

Mysterious series of Plateaus in the northeast direction from [[Alesana]]. Initial attempts to explore the area have proven to be fatal, having the members vanish to never be seen again. There does appear to have been a civilization that used to live here as you can observe a large network of bridges linking all the plateaus together.
