# Our World
---
The Abyssal Canyon is a mysterious realm born from a cataclysmic event known as The Shattering. Once part of a vast and beautiful world with endless horizons, the inhabitants were suddenly thrust into this new plane of existence. The Abyssal Canyon is an eternal canyon where the walls reach into the heavens with no way to escape. The canyon's inhabitants now struggle to adapt to their altered reality, seeking to understand the true nature of their existence in the Abyssal Canyon, and who brought them here.
