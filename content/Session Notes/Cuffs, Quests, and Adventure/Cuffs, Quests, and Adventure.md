## **Cuffs, Quests, and Adventure**

---

This journey begins as [[Stoli Gromit]], [[Tiberius Lumenara]], and [[Narif Roher]] sit in a room with an impatient Phineas behind a desk. As the silence becomes unbearable, they hear a commotion outside. The door bursts open, and two large guards throw a cocky [[Teak]] into the room. Giving the guards a forward pinky, Teak is accused of being a draft dodger. Phineas frees Teak from his cuffs and explains their mission: eliminate bandits in the woods of the [[Wavering Plains]]. He emphasizes the importance of this task due to the upcoming Fracturing and the potential issues with the influx of new people. Phineas directs them to [[Starfall Orchards]], where the Abyssal Watch has set up temporary operations. Before leaving, the mischievous Teak steals the cuffs for... reasons.

The group walks outside [[Alesana]] towards the orchards, where they're greeted by an impressive sight: the largest tent they've ever seen, surrounded by the hustle and bustle of a large operation. Narif, eager for the journey, grabs the first Boco he sees. Stoli hops onto a table and loudly asks for directions. This action disturbs a disgruntled man eating oatmeal with a single blueberry. After a brief confrontation, they're directed to the large tent.

Approaching the tent, they're instructed to collect their supplies inside. Teak, ever the smooth talker, convinces the attendant that someone named "Brian" authorized them to get a cart for their quest. Inside, they receive rations for four days and a glassite medallion. The medallion, a gold hued crystal wrapped in silver wire and chain, bears [[The Abyssal Watch]] sigil and glows faintly. They discover it allows communication over distances up to one mile.

Exiting the tent, they notice a breakfast line served by [[Labia]] the orc. Everyone receives a bowl of oatmeal with a single sad blueberry. Teak, using his charm, convinces Labia to give him all the blueberries, claiming oats would upset his stomach. This leaves Tiberius and Stoli with plain oatmeal. Realizing Labia forgot the raspberries, Teak abandons his bowl. Narif seizes the opportunity and grabs a handful of blueberries.

Tiberius, after burning his throat with hot oatmeal, notices a commotion nearby. He sees soldiers kicking something on the ground, which turns out to be a [[Young Urkin Boy]]. Tiberius intervenes, blocking a soldier's kick and confronting him about abusing a child. The soldier accuses the boy of stealing his money bag, which the boy denies. As the situation diffuses, Narif shares some blueberries with the boy. Stoli, using Thieves Cant, asks if the boy really stole the wallet. The boy replying back said “Fuck yea I did” before quickly disappearing.

As they approach the Boco corral, a flustered young girl named [[Libby]] confronts Narif about taking a Boco without permission. Teak charms Libby, explaining their mission and need for transportation. She directs them to a barn where they find a standard wagon with two Bocos. As they prepare to leave, Narif attempts to take his previous Boco but fails spectacularly, face-planting in the dirt as Libby scolds him.

With Tiberius at the helm, they set off into the Wavering Plains. Two hours into their journey, Tiberius veers off the path, shattering the wagon's left wheel. They decide to double up on the Bocos and continue forward. Entering the woods, they encounter a fork in the road. Noticing a fresh trap on the left path, they proceed along the trapped path. After careful scouting, they discover a clearing with three [[Abyssal Canyon/D&D 5e SRD/SRD - Creatures/Bandit|Bandit]]s and three [[Abyssal Canyon/D&D 5e SRD/SRD - Creatures/Flying Snake|Flying Snake]]s resting around a fire. Stoli attempts to lure a bandit into the woods by throwing a rock, but underestimates the bandits awareness, for the second the rock struck the bandits they realize they're under attack. Narif dives to the ground in preparation, while Teak draws his bow, ready for the impending confrontation.
