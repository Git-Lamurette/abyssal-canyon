## Sneaky Bandit Mayhem

---

Picking up from our last session, our adventurers face their first encounter—a group of angry bandits! After hitting the first bandit with a rock, our poor [[Stoli Gromit]] suddenly remembered he left his stove on at home and had to retreat to handle that potential disaster.

Our remaining adventurers—[[Narif Roher]], [[Tiberius Lumenara]], and [[Teak]]—find themselves confronting three s and their three accompanying [[Purple Flying Messing]]s. The battle begins immediately! Sensing danger, the initial bandit passes a secret note to the first Flying Messing and sets it free. Teak swiftly casts a hold spell to keep the Flying Messing in place. The group then quickly dispatches the bandits and snakes with minimal trouble.

After the skirmish, the group investigates the area and discovers a logbook. It details observations of the Starfall Orchards, recording the comings and goings as the Concordant prepares for the fracturing. Teak then reads the following note:

After some discussion, the group agreed to pursue this further, aware of a greater threat. The three adventurers slowly made their way down the single wide dirt road, keeping an ever-vigilant eye. [[Narif Roher]], with his wits about him, spotted the twinkling of firelight in the distance and notified his companions. As the sun set slowly behind them, they decided to stealthily dispatch the visible enemies with a surprise attack.

They swiftly took out three [[Abyssal Canyon/Creatures/Bandit|Bandit]]s around the fire and three [[Purple Flying Messing]]s that were tied up. In the ensuing ruckus, one additional bandit appeared, whom [[Teak]] quickly destroyed using the spell [[Abyssal Canyon/Spells/Shatter|Shatter]]. The echoing boom of that spell then awoke one more bandit and brought out the [[Abyssal Canyon/Creatures/Bandit Captain|Bandit Captain]] named [[Boon Docks]] .
