## **Description**

The Fracturing occurred on the 10th anniversary of the new inhabitants being thrust into this world. Long enough for the inhabitants to have begun to relax into this world. On the sleepy evening as [[Alesana]]has shut down for the night, the world shook violently, echoing the terror of The Shattering. Those awake felt intense tremors, followed by a flash of inky darkness. A mysterious voice intoned, "To the abyss we must go, for their is salvation below" reminding those that this is not our home. The most striking change manifested on [[Alesana]]northern border, where hundreds of new people materialized in the Wavering Plains where the original [[The Shattering]]took place. Unlike during The Shattering, these individuals retained their sense of self but had no recollection of their lives before the canyon. They were, in essence, lost souls thrust into an unknown world.

## Aftermath

The Fracturing of Year 25 had profound and far-reaching consequences for the Abyssal Canyon community. A massive population surge occurred as new individuals materialized, leading to social upheaval marked by increased slums and crime rates. In response, the [[The Abyssal Watch]] was increased in size and count just to maintain order, while the [[Helping Outreach Alliance (H.O.A)]] launched a huge effort growing its community goodwill among lower-class and new residents. The event also triggered a religious resurgence among the [[The Abyssalites]], whose beliefs seemed validated by these external forces shaping their existence.

Culturally, the Fracturing deeply affected the community's psyche. It reignited fear and uncertainty just as stability was taking hold, sparked existential debates about identity and the nature of their world, and paradoxically strengthened community solidarity as existing inhabitants united to face this new challenge. The long-term impact on the social and economic well being of the Abyssal Canyon was significant, reshaping the community in ways that would be felt for years to come.
